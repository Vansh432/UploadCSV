
# CSV upload

-Upload any csv file into the system (consider the delimiter to be a comma ‘ , ’) [If you don’t know what’s a csv, download the other file in this folder and take a look at it, then google a little more].

-Display a list of all uploaded csv files.
-When the user selects a file, display all the data (with column headers) in a table on the page (front end).
-There should be a search box which searches on the front end itself and displays the matching rows of the table only (empty search box displays all the data). (you can put a search on any one column).
